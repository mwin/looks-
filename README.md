# Data Science Image Processing Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on leveraging advanced image processing techniques within the data science domain to address
[specific problem or task, e.g., automated disease detection in plant leaves]. Our aim is to develop a robust solution that can efficiently analyze images,
extract relevant features, and make accurate predictions or classifications based on the data.

## Project Objectives
- To develop an efficient image processing pipeline for [specific task].
- To implement and compare various machine learning models for image classification/regression.
- To evaluate the models' performance and optimize for high accuracy and efficiency.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Programming Language: Python 3.x
- Image Processing: OpenCV, PIL
- Machine Learning Frameworks:TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- Data Handling: NumPy, pandas
- Visualization: Matplotlib, seaborn
